BESIDES the neutral expression that she wore when she was alone, Mrs. Freeman had two others, forward and reverse, that
she used for all her human dealings. Her forward expression was steady and driving like the advance of a heavy truck. 
Her eyes never swerved to left or right but turned as the story turned as if they followed a yellow line  
down the center of it. She seldom used the other expression because it was not often necessary for her to  
retract a statement, but when she did, her face came to a complete stop, there was an almost imperceptible  
movement of her black eyes, during which they seemed to be receding, and then the observer would see that Mrs. Freeman, 
though she might stand there as real as several grain sacks thrown on top of each other, was no longer there in spirit. As for 
getting anything across to her when this was the case, Mrs. Hopewell had given it up. She might talk her head  
off. Mrs. Freeman could never be brought to admit herself wrong to any point. She would stand there and if she could be brought 
to say anything, it was something like, “Well, I wouldn't of said it was and I wouldn't of said it wasn't” or letting her gaze 
range over the top kitchen shelf where there was an assortment of dusty bottles, she might remark, “I see you ain't 
ate many of them figs you put up last summer.”
